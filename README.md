# Unity-Spotify

The Unity program that integrates Spotify into Unity is a powerful tool that enhances the gaming experience by allowing players to connect their Spotify account and access their personal music library. The program uses the Spotify API to authenticate and retrieve information about the user's Spotify account, including their playlists and recently played tracks.
